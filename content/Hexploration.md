# Activities
- Decide on how you want to go about the adventuring day. 
	- Learn more about the current hex, or traversing a new hex
	- Group activities are limited by the slowest member of the group:

| Speed        | Activities Per Day |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| 10ft or less | 1/2                |
| 15-25 ft     | 1                  |
| 30-40 ft             | 2                  |
| 45-55 ft             | 3                  |
| 60+ ft             | 4                   |

- Assumes camping time and healthy resting intervals
- It is possible to split up, if you so desired, to accomplish more activities, but this would likely create distance between groups. Bear that in mind.
## Forced March
- At the beginning of the day, you can choose a forced march, as long as no one is fatigued. Gain an extra *travel* action, but traveling is all that you are able to do that day.
- Can forced march for a number of days equal to your ***Constitution Modifier***
	- Extra days of forced marching results in that character becoming fatigued until a full rest
## Group Activities
- These each count as one of the day's hexploration activities for the whole group.
### Travel
- Progress toward moving into an adjacent hex. 
	- In open terrain, such as a plain, 1 Travel moves from one hex into another.
	- Difficult terrain (forests, desert) require 2 Travels
	- Greater terrain (mountains, swamp) require 3 travels
	- Road reduces the travel time by one
### Reconnoiter
- Surveying and exploring the area, looking for unusual features or specific sites.
- Hexploration activities = actions needed to traverse the hex (plains=1, forest=2, etc.)
	- Roads do not lessen reconnoiter times
- Automatically find visible landmarks and locations; attempt checks to find anything secret or hidden, if present.
